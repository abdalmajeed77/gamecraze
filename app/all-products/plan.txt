### Comprehensive Plan for All Products Endpoint

1. **Understanding the Component**:
   - The `AllProducts` component fetches a list of products from the API endpoint `/api/product/list` and displays them using the `ProductCard` component.
   - It handles loading states and errors effectively, providing a user-friendly experience.

2. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding loading indicators while the products are being fetched.
   - Implement error handling to provide more detailed feedback to users if the fetch fails.
   - Ensure that the `ProductCard` component is optimized for performance, especially if the product list is large.

3. **Dependent Files**:
   - The `ProductCard`, `Navbar`, and `Footer` components are essential for rendering the product list and should be reviewed for any necessary updates or optimizations.

4. **Follow-up Steps**:
   - Verify the functionality of the `/api/product/list` endpoint to ensure it returns the expected data format.
   - Test the `AllProducts` component in various scenarios (e.g., no products available, fetch error) to ensure robustness.
